Thanks Sanjay Sir for giving me this oppertunity.
Friends - Very Good Afternoon, This is my first CODA, will appreciate your support and feedback.

I took this topic as my first CODA, so that i can kick start with CODA sessions.

Let's get started.

"Problem Statement:"

	We have client who wants a program where he wants to merge pdf's

	clients says, I will:
	1. Specify Directory path in command line and give output pdf name, it should merge all pdfs in that directory path location
	2. Give specific file names in command line with output pdf file name, it should merge all of them.

"Goal Statement:""

	1. Write C# program that can take inputs from command line and merge pdf's based on client inputs.

Solution Statement:

	Dev Team has chosen to suffice client requirement:
		1. iTextSharp Library
		2. C# Console App
		3. Little Suspense - on what we are arriving here

Business Benefit:
 
  1. Client can share this utility program to his company staff and improve productivity of his day to day task considering his domain.


Now Developer got excited as he got new development task from his lead developer and he started coding.

# I will add notes as we progress and build perfect program that help client.

After 1year, user got to know from one of blog that or email or some source saying iTextSharp library is deprecated.

Developer is smart since used OOPS however is missed DI, so he need to make a change at one side in his client code

//Lets do now

So in all we have learnt little bit of OOPS, seperation of concerns and you can leverage DI on this to remove client dependency.

Hope you liked it.

Thank You So Much for your time and patience.

Appreciate your presence!!

Cheers!!
